# NagaGuard

## üí° Inspiration  
Local clinics and hospitals often allocate nearly 50% of their resources and several hours daily to manually managing patient data and transcribing medical records. This inefficiency inspired **NagaGuard**, a solution aimed at reducing data management time from hours to mere seconds.

---

## üí• What It Does  
NagaGuard leverages the power of AI to transcribe medical records into clinical codes with high accuracy, providing:  
- **Automated transcription**: Transcribes medical records into clinical codes seamlessly.  
- **Readable clinical notes**: Instantly presents patients with concise, understandable clinical summaries.  
- **CRUD Operations**: Enables clinics to **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** medical records and clinical codes with ease.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It  
- **Frontend**: Developed using **ReactJS**, styled with **Bootstrap** and **CSS** for a clean and responsive user interface.  
- **AI Integration**: Incorporated **Gemini AI** to transcribe medical records into clinical codes.  
- **Backend**: Built with **Flask (Python)** to manage data processing, API routing, and CRUD functionality.  
- **Database**: Utilized **MySQL** for storing patient and doctor information, ensuring data consistency and scalability.  

---

## üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Challenges We Ran Into  
1. Setting up the **MySQL database** was initially tedious and required efficient query structuring.  
2. Formatting medical records into sections compatible with Gemini AI for transcription posed a unique challenge.

## üèÜ Accomplishments  
- **Clinical Transcription**: Successfully automated the process of transcribing records into clinical codes with **ChatGPT** integration.  
- **Efficient Data Management**: Reduced data processing time from hours to seconds.  
- **Database Expertise**: Implemented robust **CRUD operations** for managing patient and doctor data.  
- **Rapid Development**: Set up a fully functional MySQL database in under six hours.

## üí≠ What's Next for NagaGuard  
1. **AI Medical Assistant**: Develop an on-demand assistant to provide patient-side insights in real time.  
2. **Clinical Partnerships**: Collaborate with clinics and hospitals to expedite clinical coding and streamline data management processes further.  
3. **Enhanced CRUD Functionality**: Expand the CRUD operations to support more advanced queries and improve user access controls.
